        <p>This Brussels sprouts salad recipe will convince anyone that they are super yummy. </p>
        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups Brussels sprouts, halved</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon</li>
            <li>1 cup raisins</li>
            <li>1 cup coleslaw dressing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add Brussels sprouts, cover, and steam until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and pat Brussels sprouts dry.</li>
            <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool.</li>
            <li>Add Brussels sprouts to bacon grease in the skillet. Cook and stir over medium heat until coated, about 1 minute. Remove Brussels sprouts to a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Chop cooled bacon and combine with Brussels sprouts and raisins in a bowl. Pour coleslaw dressing on top and toss to combine. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour for flavors to meld.</li>
        </ol>
